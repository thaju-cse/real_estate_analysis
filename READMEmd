🏢 Real Estate Space Utilization & Revenue Analysis

Delhi | Mumbai | Pune

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes real estate rental listings across major Indian metro cities to understand pricing trends, space utilization, and revenue efficiency.
The goal is to support data-driven decisions related to pricing strategy, location selection, and space optimization for a space-providing company.

🎯 Business Objective

A real estate / space-providing company wants to:

Compare rental performance across cities

Identify high-value locations and space sizes

Evaluate pricing efficiency (price per square foot)

Understand the impact of furnishing and negotiation on rent

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (MySQL)

Power BI Desktop

CSV Data Files

Generative AI

Internet Search Engines

📂 Dataset Description

The project uses three real estate datasets:

Indian_housing_Delhi_data.csv

Indian_housing_Mumbai_data.csv

Indian_housing_Pune_data.csv

Each dataset contains rental listing information such as:

City & location

Property size (sq ft)

Monthly rent

Furnishing status

Negotiation availability

Property type

🔄 Step-by-Step Project Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Data Loading & Consolidation

Loaded all three city datasets using Python

Added a city column for consistency

Combined datasets into a single master dataframe

Outcome:
Unified dataset with ~15,000 rental listings.

🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation

Performed essential cleaning to handle real-world data issues:

Removed text like "sq ft" and commas from house_size

Converted house_size and price to numeric values

Handled missing values (balconies, negotiable flag)

Removed irrelevant columns

Removed extreme outliers using IQR method

New Features Created:

price_per_sqft

size_bucket (Small / Medium / Large)

property_id (unique identifier)

🔹 Step 3: SQL Database Setup

Imported cleaned CSV into MySQL

Defined correct data types for all columns

Added a primary key (property_id)

Created indexes on frequently queried fields (city, location)

Removed unused columns from the database

Purpose:
Enable fast, reliable analytical queries.

🔹 Step 4: Business Questions Answered Using SQL

Key SQL analyses included:

Average rent by city

Price per square foot by city

Top 10 premium locations

Performance by space size category

Impact of furnishing on rent

Negotiable vs non-negotiable pricing comparison

These queries simulate real business reporting.

🔹 Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA using Python to uncover trends and patterns:

Rent comparison across cities

Size vs price relationship

Space size category performance

Furnishing impact on pricing

Location-level price efficiency analysis

Each visualization was paired with a clear business insight.

🔹 Step 6: Power BI Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

KPI Section

Total Listings

Average Rent

Average Price per Sq Ft

Best Performing City

Best Space Size Category

Visual Analysis

Average rent by city

Price per square foot by city

Size bucket performance

Furnishing impact on rent

Top 10 premium locations table

Interactivity

Slicers for City, Size Category, and Furnishing Status

📊 Key Insights

Mumbai has the highest average rent but high price variability

Pune offers more stable pricing efficiency

Medium-sized properties provide the best revenue balance

Furnished properties command a clear rental premium

Certain locations outperform entire cities in price per sq ft

🧠 Business Impact

This analysis helps a real estate company to:

Optimize pricing strategies

Identify high-ROI locations

Decide ideal space sizes to invest in

Improve revenue through furnishing decisions

🚀 Future Enhancements

Automate data ingestion using ETL pipelines

Add time-based trend analysis

Forecast rental prices by location

Integrate additional metro cities


Key Insights that I understood:

Mumbai leads in absolute rental revenue

Pune offers better price stability

Medium-sized properties provide best ROI

Furnished properties increase revenue

Location plays a stronger role than size
